      <description>Composer Autoloading Not Just for Vendor Files
Teacher can and should learn from students! That is one of the things I find very satisfying about being an adjunct professor at Weber State University. The fact that I can learn new and usual things from those I teach. Last night was one of those times.
In fielding questions about a PHP project a comment came up about multiple autoloaders. In the first project I had the students create their own autoloader.</description>

I had been using composer for awhile but was un-aware of Satis or Toran Proxy until I attend Rafael Dohms Composer: The Right Way at php[world] 2014 in Washington, D.</description>
